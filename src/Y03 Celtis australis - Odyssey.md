Species:: Celtis australis
Source:: Jerusalem Botanical Gardens
Location:: Bonsai Bench 01
Started:: 2022
## Notes

Named after the [Lotus Eaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters) of the Odyssey because it is thought that the Nettle Tree or Celtis australis was the fruit eaten in the book. 

This is a tree I got from Ofer Grunwald from the Jerusalem Botanical Gardens that they were going to throw out. Chen Horesh will get this air layer and I will see what to do with the rest of the tree.

Cleaned up the tree during Lesson 13 with Shai Cohen and decided that the leader needs to grow
