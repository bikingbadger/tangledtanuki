## Notes 

With this bonsai leaning towards a cascade I will need to find a better pot and also create the angle slowly but sure. The current status, 2022-04-04 is more of a semi cascade but the next repot will need to remove more of the root that would be sticking up. Maybe during the growing season I will re-assess things.
