## Notes

Named after one of the Mogollon Monster from folklore. I try to name most on my Hairy Elm's after monsters from folklore

After the unbalanced push in the spring of 2023 I got in touch with Ofer Grunwald and I was able to cut back the strong growth and the tree re-distributed the energy and really had a strong push. Need to definitely keep an eye on the elms so that they don't get out of kilter in during these strong growing periods and when the tree's wake up.
