## Notes 

Picked up from Yonatan Sechvi on 2021-08-03
Named after the [Lotus Eaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters) of the Odyssey because it is thought that the Nettle Tree or Celtis australis was the fruit eaten in the book. 

August 2024 sun really hit this hard and the pump in the hydroponic bed seemed to have failed with the electrics going out for a day or two. The leaves were hit hard so decided to defoliate and see if I could get another flush before the end of the year so as not to loose everything from the year's growth.


## Goals

- Air-layer off the top of the tree in 2024
- Start building nebari to thicken bottom and the let the primaries on the bottom start to build and run to thicken them up a bit.
