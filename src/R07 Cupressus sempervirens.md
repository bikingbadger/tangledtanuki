Species:: Cupressus sempervirens
Source:: Kory Bonsai
Location:: Growfield Home Base 01
Started :: 2023
## Notes

After 6 months of growth the tree had really bounced back from the cutback of when I got the tree from Kory and actually back budded like crazy. This might be the way that a cypress reacts and something I would like to explore more. They grow like crazy and seem to be quite resilient.
## Goals

- Build the primary line
