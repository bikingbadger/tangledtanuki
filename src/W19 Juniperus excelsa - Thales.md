- Species:: Greek juniper
- Source:: Yonatan Sechvi
- Location:: Growfield Home Base 01
- Started:: 2021
## Notes 

Picked up from Yonatan Sechvi on 2021-08-03. Named after the first Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus so apt that my first Greek juniper should be named after him.

Started to prepare Thales on 2023-03-13 for the Bjorn Bonsai Workshop 2023 by cleaning the trunk from bark. Worked a bit roughly and went a bit rough. Will need to buy a proper tool for this
