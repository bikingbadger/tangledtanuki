Location:: Hydroponic Bed 01

## Notes

Named after the Thai village [Fang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fang_(town)). I think this was either a twin trunk or two different tree's that I tried to fuse together. Put into my growing field in my garden and will try to get some more roots and then also try and grow some aerial roots eventually.
