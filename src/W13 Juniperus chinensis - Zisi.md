Species:: Juniperus chinensis  
Source:: Kfar HaNassi Juniper Nursery  
Location:: Growfield Home Base 01  
Started:: 2021  
## Notes

Named after the [Chinese philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_philosophers) [Zisi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zisi) as I'll try name most of the Chinese junipers after.
## Goals

Another of my training Junipers that took a hit from my working on them when they were weak from not being healthy and also my technique not being up to scratch. Will let him recover for 2022 to regain strength and get back to full health.

The tree is currently not really strong and I need to spend 2023 just getting the tree strong and running as much as possible so that in 2024 I will be able to graft.
