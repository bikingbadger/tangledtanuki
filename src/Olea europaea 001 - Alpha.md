- Species:: Olea europaea
- Source:: Tamra Nursery
- Location:: My Bonsai Garden
- Started Training:: 2022

I relocated the tree from my old garden where it was discarded at the back and somehow survived the hot summers without water. I removed all the crazy growth that was growing. I also managed to get a few smaller plants that were growing as suckers and had some crazy roots. This was a tree that I picked up around 2010 when I wanted to get into bonsai but didn't make it. So it has been languishing for a decade but now it on it's way to being the jewel in my collection.
