Species:: Celtis australis
Source:: Jerusalem Botanical Gardens
Location:: Bonsai Bench 01
Started:: 2022
## Notes

Named after the [Lotus Eaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus-eaters) of the Odyssey because it is thought that the Nettle Tree or Celtis australis was the fruit eaten in the book. This is aparently the land that the Lotus Eaters were from [Djerba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djerba)

I've marked the front with a white tag in late autimn of 2022. In the spring of 2023 I want to airlayer the top just below the round wound half way up the truck.
