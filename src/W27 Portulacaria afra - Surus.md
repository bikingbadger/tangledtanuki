## Notes 

An old Portulacaria afra that I had started around 8 to 10 years ago from a cutting. It had some seriously lanky branches but i loved the movement. Named after the only living survivor of [Hannibal's trek](https://www.history.com/news/10-famous-elephants-from-history) over the Alps from Gaul on his way to attacking Italy from the north in 218BC.
