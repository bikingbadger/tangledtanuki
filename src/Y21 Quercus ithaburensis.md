## Notes

This was from Yamadori Hunting 001 with Yonatan Gal near  Kibbutz Mishmarot

During Lesson 21 with Ofer Grunwald we went over a bit of a cleanup and branch selection. Ofer also told me and showed how that bottom trunk without bark will always look odd so it should be planted lower and maybe even consider doing a ground layer.
