Species:: Juniperus chinensis
Source:: Kfar HaNassi Juniper Nursery
Location:: Growfield Home Base 01
Started:: 2021
## Notes

Named after the [Chinese philosopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_philosophers) [Zengzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zengzi) as I'll try name most of the Chinese junipers after.

The initial styling that I did was a bit drastic although there is still some green on the branch and luckily there is still a safety branch for me to work with. I will remove the wire and then also give the tree a repot before letting it recover over the next year.

## Current Status

The tree is not strong enough for grafts and my grafting material is not ready yet. I need to get the tree strong in 2023 and really growing strong so that in 2024 I will be able to graft
